## About this Workshop

This hands-on workshop provides users with step-by-step instructions on how to create a Non-CDB database in ExaCS using dbaascli utility.

By default, the database system that we create using OCI console in Exadata Cloud Service creates an Oracle Database 12.1,12.2, 18c or 19c using the multitenant architecture with a container database (CDB) with one pluggable databases (PDB).
